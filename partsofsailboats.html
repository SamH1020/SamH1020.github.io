    <h2>Parts of a Sailboat:</h2>
    <div class="intro">
        <p>Whether you dream of the open seas, with the salt in your hair, sun on your back and not a cloud in site. Or if you prefer a more leisurely sail down a coast line or around a bay of your choosing. If you are considering sailing, its history, or just looking for some interesting facts this is the cite for you.

    <div class="types">
        
        <ul class="t1">
            <h3> Hull:</h3>
            <li>
                The Hull is the main body of the sail boat, it keeps the occupants and other parts of the sailboat (relatively) dry.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <ul class="t1">
            <h3>Tiller:</h3>
            <li>
                The Tiller is located at the back (also called the stern) of the boat. It is in a sense the sailboat's stearing wheel, it is used to direct the rudder. The sailboat will go in the opposite direction that you point the tiller in. For example: In order to turn to the left, you would need to push the tiller to the right, which will turn the sailboat to the left.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <ul  class="t1">
            <h3>Rudder:</h3>
            <li>The Rudder is used to tell the ship what direction to go in and is controlled by the tiller. It is in a sense the Sailboats wheels.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <ul class="t1">
            <h3>Mainsail:</h3>
            <li>The Mainsail is the sailboats primary source of fuel. The purpose of the mainsail is too catch the wind and which allows the sailboat to move forward.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <ul class="t1">
            <h3>Mast:</h3>
            <li>The Mast is a long pole sticking verticlly out of the center of the sailboat, it is used to hold the main sail and the jib (also known as the head sail).</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <ul class="t1">
            <h3>Boom:</h3>
            <li>The boom is a large pole that is partway up the mast, and is parallel with the hull of the ship. It is attached to the mainsail and is used as a anchor point for one of the three corners of the mainsail, the reason for it being called the boom is becasue of the sound it makes when it hits you in the head. This is becasue in most ships it is about head height, and goes over the cockpit of the sailboat.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <ul class="t1">
            <h3>Jib (headsail):</h3>
            <li>The Jib (or headsail) is the forward sail on the ship, it is used to both accelerate the ship and use the wind to keep the ship on course.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="t1">
            <h3>The Centerboard/Daggerboard (or keel on larger sailboats):</h3>
            <li>The purpose of the Centerboard (also called the Daggerboard, or keel on larger sailboats) is too keep the ship balanced in the water, this works by both the current of the water pushing on the centerboard, This is also works when the sailboat starts to lean because of the wind, the Centerboard acts as a counter wieght, with the waves acting as the wieght. </li>
        </ul>
