<div class="types">
        <p> While there are many different types of sailboats, they are four different types of rigs that are primarily used now. 
        </p>
        <ul class="t1">
            <h3> Bermuda Rig:</h3>
            <li>
                The first one is called the Bermuda Rig, this is the most common type of sailing rigs in use today. It uses one mainsail going all the way up the mast, and one head sail also attached to the mast.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <ul class="t1">
            <h3>The Cutter Rig:</h3>
            <li>
                The Cutter Rig is alot like the Bermuda Rig, except for that instead of having one large head sail, they have two smaller head sails. This was a common set up for the boats of the 20th century, it is still common for small sailboats that plan on extended journeys as smaller sails are easier to manage by a single person, and having three sails allows for a wider variation of sail positioning, which can aid in either easy or light weather.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <ul  class="t1">
            <h3>The Ketch Rig:</h3>
            <li>
                The Ketch Rig uses two main sails instead of just one like the previous Rigs we looked at.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <ul class="t1">
            <h3>The Gaff Rig:</h3>
            <li>The Gaff Rig is traditionally used on old style sailboats, it uses a four cornered sail instead of the triangular cornered sails that we discussed previously. While the Gaff Rig is not often seen on smaller size sailboats, it was very popular on sailboats in colonial times. </li>
        </ul>
